VULCAN

Firstly, what is it not; It’s NOT Episerver Find and it’s NOT supported – not by Episerver, by me or anyone else. If you want a proper, enterprise-level, supported product with fabulous UI and integration, go dig a little in your pockets and get Find. So what IS Vulcan? It is a small, lightweight wrapper around Elasticsearch’s NEST client that provides helpers and tools to index and search for CMS and Commerce content. As of now, there is no UI (other than an indexing scheduled job) and configuration is fairly limited. That said, it’s simple and as it’s Open Source, you can do what you like with it when it comes to extending and customising it. You can even host your own Elasticsearch instance, so it could be very cost effective!
